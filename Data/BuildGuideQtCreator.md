#Build Guide for Fractorium Using MSVC2013 or Qt Creator (64 bit)
##Tools

###git

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

###Visual Studio

Install [Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx), then install the latest updates.

###Qt

Install Qt for Windows 64-bit (VS 2013) 5.5.x (http://www.qt.io/download/). 

Add system environment variable named `QTPATH` and point it to the location of the Qt folder. On a default install, this will be something like:

`C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1\5.5\msvc2013_64`

###Wix
To build the installer, you must have Wix installed. If you are unconcerned with it, you can skip this step and just dismiss the warning that shows when opening the solution later. It's recommended you ignore the installer since official builds are provided on this page.

##Obtaining source

###This project
Open up the Visual Studio x64 Native Tools Command Prompt.

Create a new folder in your development area named fractorium:

`mkdir fractorium`

`cd fractorium`

`git clone https://github.com/mfeemster/fractorium.git`

###Prerequisites
There are six prerequisite dependencies. Two of them must be downloaded manually:

[libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/)

[tbb](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download) (Intel provides executable only releases in addition to open source releases. You must get the open source release)

Extract them into the folder you created such that they are arranged like so:

```
[fractorium]
│  
├─libjpeg
├─tbb
```

Go into the fractorium folder and run this script which will get the rest of the prerequisites from git and build them:

`cd fractorium`

`makedeps.bat`

This will download and build `glm libpng libxml zlib`. You will have a folder structure like this:

```
[fractorium]
│  
├─glm
├─libjpeg
├─libpng
├─libxml2
├─tbb
└─fractorium
    │
    ├─Deps
        │
        ├─libjpeg.lib
        ├─libpng.lib
        ├─libxml2.lib
        ├─libxml2.dll
        ├─tbb.dll
        ├─tbb.lib
        ├─zlib.lib
```

##Building with Qt Creator or Visual Studio

###Begin build with Qt Creator:
Open the Qt Project `fractorium/main.pro` using Qt Creator with the default config of *Desktop Qt [version] MSVC2013 64bit*  
Select *shadow build* in *Edit build configuration* for both *Debug* and *Release*

Switch to *Release* configuration for all projects and build main.pro.

The outputs will be placed in `fractorium/Bin/release` several minutes later if no error occurs.

###Begin build with Visual Studio:

####Visual Studio Qt Addon

Install the [Visual Studio Qt Addon](http://www.qt.io/download/).

Run Visual Studio and verify there is a menu item named *Qt5*. Click on it and click *Qt Options*.

Add a new Qt version to the list with the exact name of "Qt 5.5", and set its path to the same as `$QTPATH`, which will be something like:

`C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1\5.5\msvc2013_64`

The name "Qt 5.5" must match exactly and this step must be completed before the Fractorium solution is opened. If not, the Qt add-in will completely ruin all solution and project files that use Qt.

Set the default version to the newly created Qt version and click *Ok*.

Open the file Fractorium.sln under Builds/MSVC/2013

Set the configuration to release, and build all.

###Outputs

The outputs will be the same whether Visual Studio or Qt Creator was used, however their locations will be different.

Qt Creator will place its outputs in:

`fractorium/Bin/Release`

and Visual Studio will place its outputs in:

`fractorium/Bin/x64/Release`

Regardless of the IDE chosen, the output folder will have the same contents:

```
dark.qss
Ember.dll
Ember.exp
Ember.lib
emberanimate.exe
EmberCL.dll
EmberCL.exp
EmberCL.lib
embergenome.exe
emberrender.exe
flam3-palettes.xml
fractorium.exe
libxml2.dll
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
tbb.dll
platforms\qwindows.dll
```

Double click fractorium.exe to run it, and use the command line to run the others.

To run on a computer without Visual Studio 2013, these files also need to be in the folder:

```
MSVC2013\VC\redist\x64\Microsoft.VC120.CRT\msvcp120.dll
MSVC2013\VC\redist\x64\Microsoft.VC120.CRT\msvcr120.dll
MSVC2013\VC\redist\x64\Microsoft.VC120.CRT\vccorlib120.dll
```

or you can install [Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 (64 bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
